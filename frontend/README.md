#  Kalakriti — A Celebration of Indian Traditional Arts


> “Every art form carries a story — Kalakriti brings those stories to life.”

---

##  About the Project

**Kalakriti** is an interactive web platform built to showcase, preserve, and celebrate the stunning diversity of India’s traditional arts — from folk paintings to classical dances, tribal crafts to regional textile designs.

What makes Kalakriti different? It’s not just a digital museum — it’s an **experience**. With knowledge and games, Kalakriti invites users to *feel* the culture, not just scroll through it.


---

##  Why Kalakriti?

In a time where global media dominates attention, India’s indigenous art forms often go unseen. Kalakriti aims to solve:

-  The **disconnect** between modern youth and their cultural roots.
-  The **underrepresentation** of Indian folk art online.
-  The **loss of knowledge** as oral and traditional forms fade over time.

Kalakriti digitizes this heritage with intention and interactivity — to preserve, share, and spark curiosity.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Styling**: CSS  
- **Database**: MongoDB  

---

##  Features

###  Interactive Gallery
- Explore diverse Indian art forms like **Madhubani**, **Warli**, **Kalamkari**, and **Pattachitra**.

###  Game Section

###  Learn with Play

- Dynamic, color-rich interfaces with smooth transitions.

###  Wishlist + Cart

---

##  What Sets It Apart?

-  **Cultural Authenticity**: Focused research into each art form — not just pretty visuals.
-  **Youth-Centric Design**: Made with the intention to connect with Gen Z and young learners.
-  **Gamification**: Turning culture into a playable, interactive format.
-  **Personal Touch**: Every page is a reflection of the creator’s personal love for Indian culture.

---
